### Code example:

**Finding an object by property value:**
_Write a function getProductPrice(productName) that takes one parameter, productName - the name of the product. The function looks for a product object with this name (the name property) in the products array and returns its price (the price property). If no product with the same name is found, the function returns null._

```javascript
function getProductPrice(productName) {
  for (const product of products) {
    if (product.name === productName) {
      return product.price;
    }
  }
